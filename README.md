# test-repo
This repo is used for getting hands on experience for using git and github.
<br>
README.md file is used for giving long discription about our code.<br>
First of all whenever you will get an task we have to clone the main repo in our local system and work on it.<br>
For cloning use this command " git clone 'some link' ".<br>
Use "ls" command to see files present in repo.<br>
Use "ls -a" command to see files present in repo. If in this command you see " .git " then this file has git already initialized and it is tracking it.<br>
If not then we have to first initialize git for that we use " git init". Also we have a command " git status " which shows us state of the code like staged,unmodified,modified,untracked.<br>
Now to track our changes in the file we have to add the changes in git staging area. Use command " git add 'file name' " or " git add . "<br>
Once your work is done add the file and then commit(it is record of changes) it, if you are working on your project.<br>
Use command when working on command line " git commit -m'some message' ".On github you have a button to commit changes <br>
If not then raise a pr (pull request) which will be scrutinized by head then if everthing is proper they will merge it with the main branch.<br>
