# test-repo
This repo is used for getting hands on experience for using git and github.
<br>
README.md file is used for giving long discription about our code.<br>
First of all whenever you will get an task we have to clone the main repo in our local system and work on it.<br>
For cloning use this command " git clone 'some link' ".
Use "ls" command to see files present in repo.
Use "ls -a" command to see files present in repo. If in this command you see " .git " then this file has git already initialized and it is tracking it.
If not then we have to first initialize git for that we use " git init". Also we have a command " git status " which shows us state of the code like staged,unmodified,modified,untracked.
Now to track our changes in the file we have to add the changes in git staging area. Use command " git add 'file name' " or " git add . "
